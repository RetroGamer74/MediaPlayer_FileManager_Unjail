# MediaPlayer FileManager Unjail

This project is a proof of concept. It uses a Unity for PS4 demo for video playback. It has been integrated with a file manager.

It has also provided by Trackpad and GamePad controlers for buttons and interface management.

It has also the Unjail feature to be able to get root permissions in the own application allowing you to get access to USB0 disk to load media files.

So download the ZIP package. And Built it creating a Package.

If you need help you can use this tutorial I wrote here to know how to compile from Unity a PS4 Package: https://github.com/RetroGamer74/HowToBuildWithUnityPS4FakePKG

Before to go to the browse folder icon in the main screen, press UNJAIL button. This is a proof of concept to use the Unjail Plugin Exploit I developed for using with Unity.

The main goal of this project also with this other one: https://github.com/RetroGamer74/PS4_GBEmu_FileManager_Unjail is provide to the PS4 Scene Developers a nice templates to develop homebrew.

I hope you enjoy.

VidePlayback sample is part of Unity PS4 Samples.

FileManager is an old interface integration.

I've updated to support GamePad controller.

You can take a look to the Input Manager also if you want to add more buttons support.

It has been supported also for the Gamepad Trackpad to use it as a Mouse.

The Unjail Plugin for Unity contains the minimum required source to escalate privileges. This is part of the libHB developed by @cfwprophet.
