### PS4 Video Playback Sample for Unity ###
###########################################

This sample demonsrates how to load and control a movie file on the PlayStation 4 using Unity.

Note that for space considerations, the movie file has been omitted, but please feel free to try with a file from %SCE_ORBIS_SAMPLE_DIR%\data\audio_video\video (installed with your PS4 SDK). If you want to do this automatically, an Editor utility has been made available that will copy this movie for you via PlayStation 4 > Video Sample > Get Sample Movie.
